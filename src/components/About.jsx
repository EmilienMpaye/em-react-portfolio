            Hi there! I'm  Emilien , 
a full stack developer with a passion for creating interactive and user-friendly web applications and mobile apps.
 With over two years of experience in the field, I've honed my skills in a variety of technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, React Native, Tailwind CSS, Firebase, Sanity, and GitHub for version control.

I love to work on challenging projects that push the boundaries of what's possible with modern web development, and I'm constantly exploring new technologies and best practices to stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends.

One of my specialties is developing responsive and accessible web applications that provide a consistent experience across different devices and platforms. I'm also skilled in creating mobile apps using React Native, which allows me to build native-like apps for iOS and Android with a single codebase, saving time and resources.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p className=' lg:text-lg xl:text-xl'>
            In addition to technical skills, I'm also a strong communicator and a team player. I enjoy collaborating with cross-functional teams and working closely with clients to understand their requirements and deliver solutions that meet their needs. I'm committed to writing clean, maintainable, and efficient code that follows industry best practices, and I take pride in delivering high-quality software on time and within budget.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p className=' lg:text-lg xl:text-xl'>     
Thank you for visiting my portfolio! I'm excited to share my work with you and look forward to discussing how I can contribute to your next web or mobile app project.
        </p>
